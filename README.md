### Target Users
In order to design the interaction for our social-media application we need to gather
information about the person that is going to use our application and different use cases that will
apply to him. Our target users are individuals who seek meaningful connections with other
people, inspiration from people with similar interests in activities and places, as well as
storytelling opportunities within their environment. This includes but is not limited to:
- Creative professionals looking for spaces that spark innovation and collaboration
with other people
- Community members searching for inclusive environments and the ability to
share stories and experiences
- Online content creators seeking platforms that amplify their skills and ability to
find their audience
- Individuals from excluded groups who desire to find a platform where their stories
can be valued
- People interested in architecture and urban spaces looking for a way to promote
locations that encourage social in
By understanding the needs and aspirations of these diverse user groups, we aim to
create an interactive design that seamlessly integrates into their lives, enabling them to connect,
inspire, collaborate and share with other people effectively.
### Domain-Context of Interest:
Our focus lies in designing a platform for fostering connection, inspiration, and
storytelling. These digital environments provide users with opportunities to engage, interact, and
share their experiences, ideas, and narratives in meaningful ways. By leveraging different
technologies, we aim to create immersive and inclusive online communities where users can
connect with others, find inspiration, and participate in storytelling activities based on the
location and time of the events.
### Selection criteria for interviews
- Diversity: Ensuring representation from different demographics, backgrounds, user
types in order to familiarize with different storytelling techniques and tools that should
be available and easily accessible in the final product.
- Engagement: Prioritizing the needs of individuals who actively participate in the
utilization of similar systems. This platform would thrive on containing active users of
this kind.
- Inclusivity: Including voices from marginalized or overlooked groups to ensure a
holistic understanding of user experiences.
